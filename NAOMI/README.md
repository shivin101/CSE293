### NAOMi-Sim v0.1 ###

* This repository contains the files needed to run the Neual Anatomy and Optics Microscopy (NAOMi) simulator
* The main aspects of the code are written in MATLAB, with a handful of mex files included for speed considerations
* See TPM_Simulation_Script.m for an example on the use of this code

### Basic Setup ###

* First compile the mex files in the code/mex directory (or run mex_compiling.m)
* TPM_Simulation_Script.m contains an example on how to generate and scan a volume using NAOMi-Sim
